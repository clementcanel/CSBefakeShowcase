| | **Baseline functionality** | |
| • Third-party web service API | The random image generator still doesn't really align with your app’s purpose (–1), but the interaction with the API does work | 24/25 |
| • Authentication | Authentication is done via custom Firestore implementation | 10/10 |
| • Database | Database use is derived from blog code, with storing posts, the number of likes per post, tags, and comments | 25/25 |
| | **Implementation specifications** | |
| • Model objects | Model is defined appropriately | 8/8 |
| • Interaction with back-end | App interaction with the back end is by-and-large successful, with one lingering sync glitch where likes occasionally revert to their previous value (–1) | 11/12 |
| • Abstraction of back-end | Back-end functionality is mostly abstracted out, but some lingering direct `Firestore` invocations can be seen in `ProfileView`, `CreateNewPost`, `LoginView`, and `RegisterView` (–5) | 7/12 |

| | **Other categories** | |
| Code maintainability | Maintainability is generally OK, but the code did build with three warnings, two of which appear to be very easy to fix (non-optional with `??`, unused variable). However minor, it’s always a good idea to address warnings. If ignored, they tend to build up over time and will ultimately lower the quality of the code (–2) | -2 |
| Code readability | Code readability is generally OK, but you have a lot of commented-out code (–2) | -2 |
| Version control | Good number of commits but those commit messages need to be more descriptive—try to say a little more about _what_ got updated with each commit (–2) | -2 |
| Punctuality | First commit 5/13 12:30pm; last commit 5/18 11:18pm |  |
| | **Total** | **221/250** |
