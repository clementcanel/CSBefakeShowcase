Pitch Notes 
1)- Our chosen audience is college students. 

For this desired audience, an inspiration statement for us is… beFake is a fun and unique social media app which provides a way to laugh and have friendly competition with others (friends or people all around the world) because they value fun, connection, laughter, and comparing to see who is the “fakest”.

2)- 2-3 possible solutions from the preliminary ideation

One solution for beFake is by offering incentives to the winner of whoever is the least “fake” -- whether at the end of the month, the people with the most points on the leaderboard can share a prize of, for example, 50$. This will thus attract people to want to play to win the prize and resultantly generate more traffic to the app.

Another solution is that since our targeted population is young adults and college students, there is a chance we will have potential NSFW photos pulled from the random photo generator connected to an individual's camera roll and those are things that we would not want to be posted, so we could enforce an API to restrict or blur dirty photos to ensure the longevity of the app and to make it safe for all to use.

A solution for our potential sports trivia app could be to allow for online play so one is competing with a friend simultaneously seeing who can answer the most questions correctly, the quickest. This will allow for friendly competition and excitement and never get old competing with a friend who's the most knowledgeable on their favorite subject.

Lastly, a solution to the reaction time could be by introducing the idea of having different reaction practice games for each individual's different and unique interests. For instance, if someone wants to get into nascar there could be a driving simulation where one has to avoid the obstacles by tapping the screen, and conversely if one is a domino's worker in rush hour they can work on tapping the screen to simulate a perfectly cut pizza and box fold. While this is just an example, the premise would be to allow for many different young adults and university students to increase the speed of their reaction time to their own specific niche.

3)- Our team chose to roll with App beFake during the preliminary ideation. We fleshed it out by understanding how in society today, a social media app could be really cool and popular. We think it will not be too difficult to build as it is relatively similar to the concept of beReal just with its own unique twist on it. By using firebase, and some API’s that we find we believe we can successfully put this together, and keep the aesthetic similar to beReal in order to hopefully promote positive engagement from our target audience similar to the viral sensation that beReal once received. Overall, we believe most resources are freely available. We would plan on making this app free to start and maybe even offering a small prize pool each month to promote activity and engagement and participating in the app properly by not being fake! 

4)- The final version of the human story for our app after receiving feedback from other teams….

beFake is a social media app that helps strengthen the roots of old friendships and create new friendships with other citizens from all over the world by sharing a daily photo about themselves, their environment, or anything they think is cool each day from their camera roll all in a mission to see who is the most authentic and who will need to “beFake” on a day to day basis.
