# beFake Social Media App Pitch

## Audience
Our target audience is college students.

## Inspiration Statement
**beFake** is an innovative social media app designed exclusively for college students. It offers a unique and entertaining way to connect with others globally, fostering friendly competition and laughter. Users engage in a playful comparison of authenticity to determine who can be the most "fake" in a lighthearted manner.

## Potential Solutions

### Incentive-driven Competition
One solution is to introduce an incentive-driven competition. Users with the highest points on the leaderboard at the end of each month can share a prize, such as a $50 jackpot. This gamification of authenticity encourages user participation, generating increased traffic for the app.

### Image Safety with AI
To maintain a safe and respectful environment, we will implement an API that detects and blurs inappropriate or NSFW content from users' uploaded images. This feature ensures the app remains welcoming and secure for all users, particularly young adults and college students.

### Real-time Trivia Challenges
For sports enthusiasts, the app can feature real-time trivia challenges where users compete head-to-head to answer questions accurately and quickly. This dynamic gaming element adds excitement and promotes friendly competition among users.

### Tailored Reaction Training
To address reaction time improvement, the app will offer various reaction practice games aligned with users' interests. These games will cater to individual passions, enhancing reaction skills while engaging users in their unique hobbies.

## Chosen Idea: App beFake
Our team is excited to move forward with **beFake**. Building upon the success of beReal, this concept offers a fresh take on social media engagement. We are confident in our ability to create an interactive platform using Firebase and strategic APIs, maintaining the engaging aesthetic that users loved in beReal. With readily available resources, our plan is to launch the app for free initially and potentially incorporate a monthly prize pool to encourage user activity and genuine interactions.
