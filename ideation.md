We considered middle school to high school students, as well as students who are in University. We also considered young adults freshly out of university starting new jobs or the next chapter of their life, as well as people in their low to mid 30’s starting new families and new chapters of one's life.

We ended up choosing to design this app specifically for college students but applicable to all.

10 needs:
1)- interaction with friends
2)- on social media
3)- familiar with sports
4)- social
5)- competitive
6)- in school
7)- paying attention
8)- act quick
9)- learning computer science language
10)- sleep

3 needs we have chosen--

Interaction with friends game: A game similar to the viral social media called beReal yet ours will be called beFake where you compete with your friends to see who is the “fakest”.

Familiar with sports game: A game similar to the famous show Family Feud where you play sports trivia to test your knowledge to the maximum about all current and historic sports milestones, statistics, and major moments.

Act quick game: A game where there are several quizzes one can undergo in order to test one's reaction time and see who can react the quickest to split second decisions.

Our 3 needs with goals / ideas brainstormed for them--

beFake:
Incentives and rewards for who is the realist
Both global leaderboard and local with friends
Increment of one point every time one post pic from camera roll
Can not see others post unless one post their own
Fun part of day everyday (just once a day)

Sports Game:
Compete against friends
Push yourself to learn more and more
Can pick which sport to be tested on
Can choose difficulty level
Can choose what format to answer questions (multiple choice or short answer)
Immediate feedback for correct or incorrect

Act Quick Game:
Practice memory
Test reaction time
The more one plays the harder the difficulty gets
Allow for improvement every day
Global leaderboard to check whos at the farthest level daily and all time


The winner of this process for us was beFake as we feel this app will be the most fun and enjoyable for us to create and fits really well into our desired audience of students in university. A social media app is something we are definitely excited to make, as social media is something which is certainly not going away in the future, so an interesting tweak on an already existing app is something we are very excited about!
